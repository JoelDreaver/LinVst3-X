# LinVst3-X

Vst3 wrapper (beta).

For 64 bit vst3's only.

Not all vst3 features are supported.

Same usage applies as per LinVst-X except that it's linvst3x.so instead of linvstx.so and the vst dll filename extensions are .vst3 instead of .dll https://github.com/osxmidi/LinVst/wiki https://github.com/osxmidi/LinVst/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/osxmidi/LinVst/tree/master/Detailed-Guide

So for example, linvst3x.so would be renamed to Delay.so for Delay.vst3 (see convert folder for batch name conversion utilities)

The vst3 dlls are most likely going to be in ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Common Files/VST3

LinVst3-X will try to produce multiple loader part files for vst3's that contain multiple plugins. 
The multiple loader part files should be picked up on the daw's next plugin scan and then the multiple plugins should be available for use in the daw.

Some vst3's might not work due to Wines current capabilities or for some other reason.

-------

LinVst3-X binaries are on the releases page (under Assets) https://github.com/osxmidi/LinVst3-X/releases

To Make

sudo apt-get install cmake

Libraries that need to be pre installed, 

sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libxcb-util0-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libsqlite3-dev

Wine libwine development files.

------

For Ubuntu/Debian, sudo apt-get install libwine-development-dev (For Debian, Wine might need to be reinstalled after installing libwine-development-dev)

wine-devel packages for other distros (sudo apt-get install wine-devel).

libX11 development (sudo apt-get install libx11-dev)

------

For Fedora 

sudo yum -y install wine-devel wine-devel.i686 libX11-devel libX11-devel.i686
sudo yum -y install libstdc++.i686 libX11.i686

------

For Manjaro/Arch

sudo pacman -Sy wine-staging
sudo pacman -Sy libx11
sudo pacman -Sy gcc-multilib

sudo pacman -Sy cmake
sudo pacman -Sy freetype2
sudo pacman -Sy sqlite
sudo pacman -Sy libxcb
sudo pacman -Sy xcb-util 
sudo pacman -Sy gtkmm3
sudo pacman -Sy xcb-util-cursor

------

(Optional libraries, Maybe needed for some systems),

libx11-xcb-dev
libxcb-util-dev
libxcb-cursor-dev
libxcb-xkb-dev
libxkbcommon-dev
libxkbcommon-x11-dev
libfontconfig1-dev
libcairo2-dev
libgtkmm-3.0-dev
libsqlite3-dev
libxcb-keysyms1-dev

-------

This LinVst3-X source folder needs to be placed within the VST3 SDK main folder (the VST3_SDK folder or the VST3 folder that contains the base, public.sdk, pluginterfaces etc folders) ie the LinVst3-X source folder needs to be placed alongside the base, public.sdk, pluginterfaces etc folders of the VST3 SDK.

Then change into the LinVst3-X folder and run make and then sudo make install

Then use the batch name conversion utilities (in the convert/binaries folder) to name convert linvst3x.so to the vst3 plugin names ie first select linvst3x.so and then select the ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Common Files/VST3 folder https://github.com/osxmidi/LinVst/wiki

Currently builds ok with the vstsdk3613_08_04_2019_build_81

To make using the vst2sdk, remove the -DVESTIGE entries from the Makefile and place the vst2sdk pluginterfaces folder inside the main LinVst3-X source folder.
