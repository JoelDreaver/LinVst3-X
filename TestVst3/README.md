# TestVst3

TestVst3 can roughly test how a vst3 plugin might run under Wine.

It tries to open the vst3 and display the vst3 window for roughly 8 seconds and then closes.

Usage is ./testvst3.exe "vst3file.vst3"

paths and vst3 filenames that contain spaces need to be enclosed in quotes.

testvst3.exe is for 64 bit vst3's only
